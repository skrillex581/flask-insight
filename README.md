# flask-insight
The `insight`ful thingamajig. Based on the [Flask megatutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

#Meta
* Redoing the flask megatutorial and then some more.
* Basically I want to incorporate some stuff I've learned in the last few months into the walkthrough project.
* There's `pip`, `virtualenv`, `git` and of course getting `travis-ci` to build your application and run its tests using `nose`.
* I will show how to add `markdown` editor to the blog, convert entries to a templated `pdf` document (merge + convert)

#Install instructions
* I recommend you do this in a `virtualenv`
* Install pip
* `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`
