# NO LONGER MAINTAINED
flask is dead.

# flask-insight
The `insight`ful thingamajig. Based on the [Flask megatutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

#Meta
* Redoing the flask megatutorial and then some more.
* Basically I want to incorporate some stuff I've learned in the last few months into the walkthrough project.
* In my mind flask is dead for front-end development, it's only good for developing web API applications.
* There's `pip`, `virtualenv`, `git` and of course getting `travis-ci` to build your 
application and run its tests using `nose`. This is also a learning exercise for me.
* I will show how to add `markdown` editor to the blog, convert entries to a templated `pdf` document (merge + convert)


#Install instructions
* I recommend you do this in a `virtualenv` so as not to muck up your global libs.
* Install pip
* `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`
